\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we successfully built the four-arm robot and achieve the function of welding in a specific area. We designed all the relevant data and reduced the errors by simulink. The maximum error in end effector position on the x and z axes is below 0.05, while the maximum error on the y axis is slightly over 0.10, and the largest error of joint angle is joint2 angle, and it just nearly reaches 0.02. These errors are far better than the standards set. Overall, we achieved the desired results. This is certainly a product worth buying and will bring unimaginable benefits to your company.
