\section{Brief report}

	\noindent Dear Officer:
	
	\noindent We understand that you are looking for a welding robot for the automotive industry and our team has found our product to be the right fit for your needs. I will then briefly describe our robot and show its advantages in terms of design and precision.
	
	\noindent We have designed a \textbf{four-armed robot} according to your requirements and have \textbf{considered its parameters}, which you can see in Table \ref*{T 2.1} and Table \ref*{T 2.2}. After simulation analysis, this design is reasonable and can perform the task accurately in the working area. We have also created a \textbf{kinematic diagram} (Figure \ref{F 4.1}) and a \textbf{workspace diagram} (Figure \ref{F 3.1}). At the same time, this four-armed robot also has \textbf{greater stability} and a \textbf{larger working area}.
	
	\noindent In terms of the \textbf{working path}, we have innovatively added a \textbf{one-second stabilization time}, which will make the work more stable. In the simulation, we set a 48-second working time which can be adjusted according to the specific situation. Figure \ref{F 5.3}  is a \textbf{schematic diagram} of the work.
	
	\noindent In Simulink, we conducted a detailed analysis of the errors. The maximum error in end effector position on the \textbf{x and z axes} is \textbf{below 0.05}, while the maximum error on the \textbf{y axis} is slightly \textbf{over 0.10}, and the largest error of joint angle is joint 2 angle, and it just nearly \textbf{reaches 0.02}. This indicates that the robot's motion and working process far exceed the standard accuracy. You can see the specific error images in Figure \ref{F 5.11} and Figure \ref{F 5.12}.
	
	\noindent Taking these advantages into account, I believe that our product is worth purchasing for your company and will bring substantial benefits. Next are the detailed design aspects of the robot.
