\section{Brief report}

	\noindent Dear Officer:
	
	\noindent We understand that you are looking for a welding robot for the automotive industry and our team has found our product to be the right fit for your needs. I will then briefly describe our robot and show its advantages in terms of design and precision.
	
	\noindent We have designed a four-armed robot according to your requirements and have considered its parameters, which you can see in Table 1 and Table 2. After simulation analysis, this design is reasonable and can perform the task accurately in the working area. We have also created a kinematic diagram (Figure 2.1) and a workspace diagram (Figure 3.1)
	
	\noindent The maximum error in end effector position on the x and z axes is below 0.05, while the maximum error on the y axis is slightly This shows the amazing accuracy of the robot in its movements and workings. You can see the specific images of the errors in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the behaviour of a mild steel portal frame model when subjected to increasing loads.

The rig consists of a loading system that applies a vertical load at the center of the beam and a horizontal load at the top of one column. As shown in \autoref{f0}.
